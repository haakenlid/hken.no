## About the project

Pretty standard real estate brochure. The design is based on an existing
brochure that the client had made for a different project. Since they didn't
have the original design files, I recreated it from a printed booklet. I
processed and retouched the photos. I also created a map by importing data
from OpenStreetMap into adobe illustrator to create a custom style, and made
floor plans from technical drawings.
