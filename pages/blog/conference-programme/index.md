## About the project

A 40 page programme booklet in size A6. The challenge was to make it small
enough to carry in a pocket while keeping the text legible.
I wrote some scripts to export the programme data from google docs and quickly
import it into the indesign document. I used some indesign paragraph style
tricks to make the colour coded boxes for each programme entry.
